    "description": "A businessman must decide how many units to purchase and how many to reserve for later periods in order to maximize revenue over a 3-period horizon. The simulation uses Monte Carlo methods (with 1,000,000 iterations) to estimate mean revenue based on stochastic demand. The objective is to maximize mean revenue, computed as the sales revenue minus the purchase cost. Feasibility requires that the reserved amounts are nonincreasing over time.",
